This study examines species delimitation within the Bromeliaceae family using machine learning algorithms to analyze single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants. Traditional species identification methods often rely on morphological traits, which may not capture the full extent of genetic diversity. This project employs two machine learning approaches, XGBoost (Chen 2016) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP, Rosenblatt 1962), to explore the genetic foundations of species differentiation. Our analysis includes eight species across five genera, sequenced by low-coverage genome skimming. The results demonstrate the potential of machine learning to enhance species delimitation with high accuracy and confidence, offering significant contributions to taxonomy and conservation biology.
